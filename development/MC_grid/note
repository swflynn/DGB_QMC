mc_grid_shane is the original code  I wrote
mc_grid is an updates version with vlads help to optimize

calcualtion seems very sensitive to the lennard-jones  parameter c

needs the sobol.f90 code

code uses an initial gaussian distribution generated with sobol points
We then use MMC (Metropolis Monte Carlo) to move to points to an optimal spacing  with a pair potential (LJ) and an underlyign distribution PX (hardcoded gaussian for now)
